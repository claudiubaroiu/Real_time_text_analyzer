📝 Real-Time Text Analyzer

Real-Time Text Analyzer is an interactive React-based web application that analyzes any text you type in real time. It provides instant and detailed statistics such as:

-Total character count

-Word count

-Sentence count

-Letter density (frequency and percentage of each letter)

🚀 Key Features

🔹 Real-time analysis

All statistics update instantly as you type.

🔹 Option to exclude spaces

By enabling “Exclude spaces”, character counting ignores whitespace.

🔹 Character limit

You can set a maximum character limit — the text is automatically trimmed to match your input.

🔹 Light/Dark Mode support

The interface adapts visually depending on the theme selected in the parent application.

🔹 Letter frequency visualization

See how often each letter (A–Z) appears in your text and what percentage it represents.
If the list is long, only the top 5 letters are shown by default, with an option to reveal all.
